# Simulation and Monte Carlo Project - Ensae Paris - 2nd year

In this project, two approaches are used to approximate the optimal solution of a TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem).

Both approaches are based on Reuven Rubinstein's Cross Entropy Method. 
The second approach study the effect of adding a Bayesian component in the algorithm.
`Presentation.pdf` is our presentation from our defense during the 2019 class.
